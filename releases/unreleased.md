# Unreleased

This is the living release note for the next coordinated AppSurface version after `0.2.0-preview.2`. It stays provisional until the next tag is cut.

## What is taking shape

- Add merged public changes here as they land.

## Included in the next coordinated version

### Release and docs surface

- AppSurface DevAuth now centralizes its environment activation policy. DevAuth remains Development-by-default, but
  package consumers can explicitly add local/proof environment names through `AllowedEnvironmentNames`; the marker
  self-suppresses outside allowed environments and mapped control/mutation endpoints stay fail-closed.
- Split stable and prerelease NuGet publish tag triggers so prerelease tags no longer start the stable publish workflow before the prerelease gate.
- AppSurface DevAuth marker overlays now start collapsed by default while keeping the active fake persona visible, and
  `AppSurfaceDevAuthMarkerOptions.StartExpanded` lets local proof pages opt back into immediate persona controls.

## Migration watch

- Record breaking or behavior-changing guidance here before it moves into the tagged release note.
