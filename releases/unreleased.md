# Unreleased

This is the living release note for the next coordinated AppSurface version after `0.1.0-rc.2`. It stays provisional until the next tag is cut.

## What is taking shape

- Add merged public changes here as they land.

## Included in the next coordinated version

### Release and docs surface

- AppSurface Web browser status-page re-execution now preserves the original `401`, `403`, or `404` response status while rendering conventional browser recovery pages, so standalone docs 404 recovery keeps `NotFound` semantics across supported runtimes.
- `razorwire export` and `appsurface export` now accept `--publish-root-extras <manifest>` for explicit single-file publish-root extras such as GitHub Pages `CNAME`, with `RWEXPORT007` validation for schema, symlink, reserved provider file, generated-output collision, existing-target, and exact release archive incompatibility failures. `appsurface docs export` remains intentionally clean and does not expose the option for exact docs archive artifacts.

### CI and package validation

- CI now includes a measured NuGet cache rollout for selected build, docs export, and code-quality jobs while keeping package-gate restores isolated.
- PackageIndex verification now ignores hidden local cache directories such as `.pnpm-store` and workspace `.nuget/packages` so local cache contents do not require package manifest entries.

## Migration watch

- Record breaking or behavior-changing guidance here before it moves into the tagged release note.
