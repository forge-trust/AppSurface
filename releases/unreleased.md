# Unreleased

This is the living release note for the next coordinated AppSurface version after `0.1.0-rc.3`. It stays provisional until the next tag is cut.

## What is taking shape

- AppSurface CI can now prove the default full-solution coverage lane through the source `appsurface coverage run` command without waiting on matrix fan-in workflows.

## Included in the next coordinated version

### Release and docs surface

- AppSurface CI coverage now dogfoods the source `appsurface coverage run` command for the default full-solution lane. The lane preserves the existing merged Cobertura, managed JUnit, slow-test diagnostics, Codecov, and `coverage gate` evidence paths while `scripts/coverage-solution.sh` keeps legacy compatibility for grouped runs, group listing, merge-only runs, `TEST_GROUP`, and `BUILD_SOLUTION=false`.
- `appsurface coverage run` now supports `--test-results junit` for AppSurface-managed top-level JUnit artifacts. `--slow-test-diagnostics` implies managed JUnit results and writes diagnostics from those files; `junit` is the only managed result format in this release, with TRX/TUnit compatibility reserved for #491.
- Coverage runs now emit `slow-test-diagnostics.md` and `slow-test-diagnostics.json` next to the merged coverage artifacts. The diagnostics rank project and JUnit test-case timings, preserve best-effort parser warnings without changing coverage exit codes, record metadata completeness, and report diagnostic aggregation overhead in seconds and as a percent of total runner time.

## Migration watch

- Record breaking or behavior-changing guidance here before it moves into the tagged release note.
