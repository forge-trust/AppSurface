# Unreleased

This is the living release note for the next coordinated AppSurface version after `0.1.0-rc.4`. It stays provisional until the next tag is cut.

## What is taking shape

- `ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Auth` now defines durable external-subject to app-user-id mapping contracts without taking on user-store, ASP.NET Core, OIDC, EF Core, Aspire, or tenant-authority responsibilities.
- Sanitized AppSurface Config audit diffs for comparing captured runtime configuration reports.

## Included in the next coordinated version

### Release and docs surface

- Added `ExternalSubject`, `AppUserId`, `IAppSurfaceUserIdentityResolver`, `AppSurfaceUserIdentityResolutionContext`, `AppSurfaceUserIdentityResult`, and `AppSurfaceUserIdentityStatus`, with README guidance for uniqueness, idempotency, cancellation, concurrency, PII-safe diagnostics, and ASP.NET Core adapter integration planning.
- AppSurface Config now exposes a sanitized config audit diff surface. `ConfigAuditReportDiffer` compares two existing `ConfigAuditReport` snapshots without re-resolving providers, `ConfigAuditDiffTextRenderer` renders deterministic same-host or captured-snapshot evidence with redaction uncertainty called out, and `ConfigAuditDiffCommandRunner` gives apps command-framework-agnostic same-host and captured JSON workflows with display-safe problem/cause/fix/docs-link failures.

## Migration watch

- `AppSurfaceUser.Id` remains a host-owned subject identifier in the existing ASP.NET Core adapter. Consumers that need durable app-owned users should resolve that subject through the new identity resolver contract instead of treating the mapped subject claim as an app user id.
