# Unreleased

This is the living release note for the next coordinated AppSurface version after `0.1.0-rc.4`. It stays provisional until the next tag is cut.

## What is taking shape

- `ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Auth.AspNetCore` now includes AppSurface-shaped Minimal API policy helpers: `AddAppSurfacePolicy(...)` keeps policy definition in ASP.NET Core, while `RequireSurfacePolicy(...)` evaluates the named host policy through the existing AppSurface evaluator and returns API-safe ProblemDetails JSON for challenge, forbid, missing-policy, missing-service, and missing-subject outcomes instead of triggering browser redirects.

## Included in the next coordinated version

### Release and docs surface

- Add release-facing changes here.

## Migration watch

- Record breaking or behavior-changing guidance here before it moves into the tagged release note.
