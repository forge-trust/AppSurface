# Changelog

This changelog is the compact release ledger for AppSurface. The monorepo ships in unison, so each tagged version covers packages, CLI tooling, examples, and docs-facing behavior from this repository together.

## Reading guide

- `Unreleased` tracks the next coordinated version and points to the living release note.
- Future tagged sections will use the shape `## x.y.z - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Every tagged section will link to a matching narrative release note in [`releases/`](./releases/README.md).
- Breaking or behavior-changing updates must record migration guidance here and in the matching release note.

## Unreleased

- Narrative release note: [Upcoming release note](./releases/unreleased.md)
- Upgrade policy: [Pre-1.0 upgrade policy](./releases/upgrade-policy.md)
- Authoring workflow: [Release authoring checklist](./releases/release-authoring-checklist.md)
- AppSurface Config can now compare sanitized audit reports, render deterministic same-host or captured-snapshot evidence, and expose command-framework-agnostic diff workflows with display-safe failures.
- AppSurface Flow now uses value-type execution contexts and deeper benchmark coverage to reduce and track synchronous in-memory runner allocation overhead.
