# ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Dependency.Autofac

Autofac IoC container integration for AppSurface modules.

## Overview

This package allows modules to participate in Autofac service registration, enabling advanced DI features not available in the default .NET service collection.

## Release Guidance

AppSurface ships as a coordinated package family. Before installing this package from a prerelease feed, check the [package chooser](../../packages/README.md) and [release hub](../../releases/README.md) for current release risk, migration guidance, and readiness.

## Usage

Inherit from `AppSurfaceAutofacModule` instead of `IAppSurfaceModule` if you need to use Autofac-specific registrations.

```csharp
public class MyAutofacModule : AppSurfaceAutofacModule
{
    protected override void Load(ContainerBuilder builder)
    {
        // Custom Autofac registrations
    }
}
```
