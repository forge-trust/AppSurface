# ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Evidence.Contracts

`ForgeTrust.AppSurface.Evidence.Contracts` is the stable vocabulary for a CI run that says what changed, which evidence was required, what actually ran, and whether a downstream gate may consume the result.

Start with the [EvidenceHost guide](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/blob/main/start-here/evidencehost.md) before installing a package. Use this package directly only when you are authoring a consumer-owned producer, policy tool, or gate integration. It starts no process, discovers no test code, provisions no resources, and sends no telemetry.

## Release Guidance

AppSurface ships as a coordinated package family. Before installing this package
from a prerelease feed, check the [package chooser](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/blob/main/packages/README.md) and [release hub](https://github.com/forge-trust/AppSurface/blob/main/releases/README.md)
for current release risk, migration guidance, and readiness.

## Contract shape

An `EvidencePolicy` resolves into an immutable `EvidencePlan`. A run records declared `EvidenceProducerResult` values and then uses `EvidenceManifestBuilder.Build(...)` to produce an `EvidenceManifest`. Both plan and manifest have canonical JSON and SHA-256 digests, so a gate can verify a result without rerunning the test suite.

| Type family | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `EvidencePolicy`, `EvidenceProfile`, `EvidencePolicyRule` | Checked-in change-risk policy and explicitly selected profile. |
| `EvidenceResourceDeclaration`, `EvidenceProducerDeclaration`, `EvidenceObligation` | Closed declaration of resource readiness, producer assertions/artifacts, and the risk obligation each assertion may close. |
| `EvidencePlan`, `NormalizedDiffPath` | Deterministic resolved input. The plan binds policy identity, diff, selected profile, and matched rules. |
| `EvidenceProducerResult`, `EvidenceManifest` | Terminal producer outcomes and the resulting gate claim. |
| `EvidenceCanonicalJson`, `EvidenceDigest`, `EvidenceManifestBuilder` | Canonical serialization, digesting, claim calculation, and manifest verification. |

### Bounded JSON input

`EvidenceCanonicalJson.Deserialize<T>(ReadOnlySpan<byte>)` preserves the existing in-memory entry point and enforces a protected **20 MiB** input ceiling. Use `DeserializeAsync<T>(Stream, maximumBytes, cancellationToken)` when reading a file or another stream: it counts bytes while reading, does not depend on seekability or advertised length, and stops after observing the first byte over the limit, before parsing or allocating a full document. The stream remains owned by the caller. `maximumBytes` may lower the ceiling (including zero) but cannot raise it. The span overload with an explicit limit is available for callers that already hold bytes.

All deserialization entry points reject malformed JSON, duplicate or case-colliding property names anywhere in the document, unknown enum strings, and numeric enum values. Known enum names remain case-insensitive. Required constructor members must be present; non-nullable members and contract collection items cannot be `null`. Optional constructor defaults and explicitly nullable fields remain supported. Unknown object properties are ignored so additive optional fields remain compatible; they are also omitted when the parsed contract is serialized again. `EvidencePlan` and `EvidenceManifest` must declare contract version `1.0`, the only version currently emitted by the planner and manifest builder. Diagnostics use bounded generic messages: size and stream-read failures throw `InvalidDataException`, schema and JSON failures throw `JsonException`, invalid lower-limit arguments throw `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, and stream cancellation propagates `OperationCanceledException`.

The span overload cannot limit memory already allocated by its caller. Prefer the counted stream overload at an untrusted file or stream boundary, and do not use a stream length check as a substitute for counted reading. These methods validate structure and format; they do not authenticate who supplied the JSON or make a plan trusted.

`EvidenceClaimKind.TargetedComplete` is eligible for a pull-request gate; `ReleaseComplete` is eligible only for a release gate and requires `ValidatedNotAttested` envelope status. `ObservationOnly` is deliberately informative, never gate-eligible. `NoEvidenceRequired` is valid only when the selected profile declares no resources, producers, or obligations.

## Claim rules

A complete claim is deliberately conservative:

- every selected producer must report `Passed`;
- every obligation's required producer and assertion must be present;
- producer results may not name undeclared producers or assertions;
- a release profile requires a registered CI-envelope verifier; and
- the manifest digest and plan digest must verify unchanged.

An unavailable capability, timeout, skipped producer, incomplete test profile, or failed assertion therefore produces `None`, not a partial success. This is how EvidenceHost distinguishes an observation from evidence that can mediate risk.

## Pitfalls

- Do not construct a `NoEvidenceRequired` result merely because a local run omitted tests. It is a policy outcome, not a convenience override.
- Do not treat a coverage collection artifact as a gate pass unless its producer has closed the assertion declared by the selected policy.
- Do not claim independent attestation in v1. An accepted envelope is represented as `ValidatedNotAttested`.
- Do not edit generated plan or manifest JSON. `EvidenceManifestBuilder.Verify(...)` and `appsurface evidence verify` detect inconsistent or edited claim fields by recomputing internal digests; they do not authenticate their inputs. Gates must obtain the plan and manifest through a trusted CI channel.
